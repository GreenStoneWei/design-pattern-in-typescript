> Structural patterns concern class and object composition. 

They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- **Adapter** allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
- **Bridge** decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite** composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
- **Decorator** dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object.
- **Facade** provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
- **Flyweight** reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy** provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.
